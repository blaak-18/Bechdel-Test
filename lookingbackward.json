Society would indeed have fully deserved being devoured if it had failed to answer a riddle so entirely simple . In fact , to speak by the book , it was not necessary for society to solve the riddle at all . It may be said to have solved itself . The solution came as the result of a process of industrial evolution which could not have terminated otherwise . All that society had to do was to recognize and cooperate with that evolution , when its tendency had become unmistakable .

Public opinion had become fully ripe for it , and the whole mass of the people was behind it . There was no more possibility of opposing it by force than by argument . On the other hand the popular sentiment toward the great corporations and those identified with them had ceased to be one of bitterness , as they came to realize their necessity as a link , a transition phase , in the evolution of the true industrial system . The most violent foes of the great private monopolies were now forced to recognize how invaluable and indispensable had been their office in educating the people up to the point of assuming control of their own business . Fifty years before , the consolidation of the industries of the country under national control would have seemed a very daring experiment to the most sanguine . But by a series of object lessons , seen and studied by all men , the great corporations had taught the people an entirely new set of ideas on this subject . They had seen for many years syndicates handling revenues greater than those of states , and directing the labors of hundreds of thousands of men with an efficiency and economy unattainable in smaller operations . It had come to be recognized as an axiom that the larger the business the simpler the principles that can be applied to it ; that , as the machine is truer than the hand , so the system , which in a great concern does the work of the master 's eye in a small business , turns out more accurate results . Thus it came about that , thanks to the corporations themselves , when it was proposed that the nation should assume their functions , the suggestion implied nothing which seemed impracticable even to the timid . To be sure it was a step beyond any yet taken , a broader generalization , but the very fact that the nation would be the sole corporation in the field would , it was seen , relieve the undertaking of many difficulties with which the partial monopolies had contended .

The organization of society with you was such that officials were under a constant temptation to misuse their power for the private profit of themselves or others . Under such circumstances it seems almost strange that you dared entrust them with any of your affairs . Nowadays , on the contrary , society is so constituted that there is absolutely no way in which an official , however ill-disposed , could possibly make any profit for himself or any one else by a misuse of his power . Let him be as bad an official as you please , he can not be a corrupt one . There is no motive to be . The social system no longer offers a premium on dishonesty . But these are matters which you can only understand as you come , with time , to know us better . '' ","i":15050},{"w":"`` The moment the nation assumed the responsibilities of capital those difficulties vanished , '' ","i":15300},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":15418},{"w":"`` that was something which followed as a matter of course as soon as the nation had become the sole capitalist . The people were already accustomed to the idea that the obligation of every citizen , not physically disabled , to contribute his military services to the defense of the nation was equal and absolute . That it was equally the duty of every citizen to contribute his quota of industrial or intellectual services to the maintenance of the nation was equally evident , though it was not until the nation became the employer of labor that citizens were able to render this sort of service with any pretense either of universality or equity . No organization of labor was possible when the employing power was divided among hundreds or thousands of individuals and corporations , between which concert of any kind was neither desired , nor indeed feasible . It constantly happened then that vast numbers who desired to labor could find no opportunity , and on the other hand , those who desired to evade a part or all of their debt could easily do so . '' ","i":15426},{"w":"`` It is rather a matter of course than of compulsion , '' ","i":15634},{"w":"`` The supply of volunteers is always expected to fully equal the demand , '' ","i":16536},{"w":"`` Not necessarily , '' ","i":17571},{"w":"`` while frequent and merely capricious changes of occupation are not encouraged or even permitted , every worker is allowed , of course , under certain regulations and in accordance with the exigencies of the service , to volunteer for another industry which he thinks would suit him better than his first choice .

Not only this , but a worker may likewise , under suitable regulations and not too frequently , obtain a transfer to an establishment of the same industry in another part of the country which for any reason he may prefer . Under your system a discontented man could indeed leave his work at will , but he left his means of support at the same time , and took his chances as to future livelihood . We find that the number of men who wish to abandon an accustomed occupation for a new one , and old friends and associations for strange ones , is small . It is only the poorer sort of workmen who desire to change even as frequently as our regulations permit . Of course transfers or discharges , when health demands them , are always given .

If he feels that he can do better work with his brains than his muscles , he finds every facility provided for testing the reality of his supposed bent , of cultivating it , and if fit of pursuing it as his avocation . The schools of technology , of medicine , of art , of music , of histrionics , and of higher liberal learning are always open to aspirants without condition . '' ","i":17904},{"w":"`` Are not the schools flooded with young men whose only motive is to avoid work ?

It would have been reason enough , had there been no other , for abolishing money , that its possession was no indication of rightful title to it . In the hands of the man who had stolen it or murdered for it , it was as good as in those which had earned it by industry . People nowadays interchange gifts and favors out of friendship , but buying and selling is considered absolutely inconsistent with the mutual benevolence and disinterestedness which should prevail between citizens and the sense of community of interest which supports our social system . According to our ideas , buying and selling is essentially anti-social in all its tendencies . It is an education in self-seeking at the expense of others , and no society whose citizens are trained in such a school can possibly rise above a very low grade of civilization . '' ","i":22345},{"w":"`` The provision is so ample that we are more likely not to spend it all , '' ","i":22581},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":23164},{"w":"`` it was the only practicable way under a system which made the interests of every individual antagonistic to those of every other ; but it would have been a pity if humanity could never have devised a better plan , for yours was simply the application to the mutual relations of men of the devil 's maxim , ` Your necessity is my opportunity . ' The reward of any service depended not upon its difficulty , danger , or hardship , for throughout the world it seems that the most perilous , severe , and repulsive labor was done by the worst paid classes ; but solely upon the strait of those who needed the service .

The favored trades would have too many volunteers , and those discriminated against would lack them till the errors were set right .

The amount of the effort alone is pertinent to the question of desert . All men who do their best , do the same . A man 's endowments , however godlike , merely fix the measure of his duty . The man of great endowments who does not do all he might , though he may do more than a man of small endowments who does his best , is deemed a less deserving worker than the latter , and dies a debtor to his fellows .

In fact , you will find , Mr. West , as you come to know us , that there is far less interference of any sort with personal liberty nowadays than you were accustomed to . We require , indeed , by law that every man shall serve the nation for a fixed period , instead of leaving him his choice , as you did , between working , stealing , or starving . With the exception of this fundamental law , which is , indeed , merely a codification of the law of nature -- the edict of Eden -- by which it is made equal in its pressure on men , our system depends in no particular upon legislation , but is entirely voluntary , the logical outcome of the operation of human nature under rational conditions . This question of inheritance illustrates just that point . The fact that the nation is the sole capitalist and land-owner of course restricts the individual 's possessions to his annual credit , and what personal and household belongings he may have procured with it . His credit , like an annuity in your day , ceases on his death , with the allowance of a fixed sum for funeral expenses . His other possessions he leaves as he pleases . '' ","i":30123},{"w":"`` It is precisely because we are all social equals whose equality nothing can compromise , and because service is honorable , in a society whose fundamental principle is that all in turn shall serve the rest , that we could easily provide a corps of domestic servants such as you never dreamed of , if we needed them , '' ","i":30801},{"w":"`` The fact , '' ","i":30992},{"w":"`` In case of special emergencies in the household , '' ","i":31117},{"w":"`` such as extensive cleaning or renovation , or sickness in the family , we can always secure assistance from the industrial force .

Anybody who pleases to get a little smattering of medical terms is not now at liberty to practice on the bodies of citizens , as in your day . None but students who have passed the severe tests of the schools , and clearly proved their vocation , are permitted to practice . Then , too , you will observe that there is nowadays no attempt of doctors to build up their practice at the expense of other doctors . There would be no motive for that . For the rest , the doctor has to render regular reports of his work to the medical bureau , and if he is not reasonably well employed , work is found for him .

The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a loose form of federal union of world-wide extent . An international council regulates the mutual intercourse and commerce of the members of the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races , which are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions . Complete autonomy within its own limits is enjoyed by every nation . '' ","i":36857},{"w":"`` The price at which one nation supplies another with goods , '' ","i":37206},{"w":"`` must be that at which it supplies its own citizens . So you see there is no danger of misunderstanding . Of course no nation is theoretically bound to supply another with the product of its own labor , but it is for the interest of all to exchange some commodities . If a nation is regularly supplying another with certain goods , notice is required from either side of any important change in the relation . '' ","i":37223},{"w":"`` Such a case has never occurred , and could not without doing the refusing party vastly more harm than the others , '' ","i":37333},{"w":"`` When you come to know how prices of all commodities are determined nowadays , you will perceive how impossible it is that they could be altered , except with reference to the amount or arduousness of the work required respectively to produce them , '' ","i":37523},{"w":"`` On the contrary , there is constant emigration , by which I suppose you mean removal to foreign countries for permanent residence , '' ","i":38048},{"w":"`` An American credit card , '' ","i":38287},{"w":"`` is just as good in Europe as American gold used to be , and on precisely the same condition , namely , that it be exchanged into the currency of the country you are traveling in . An American in Berlin takes his credit card to the local office of the international council , and receives in exchange for the whole or part of it a German credit card , the amount being charged against the United States in favor of Germany on the international account . '' ","i":38298},{"w":"`` And increased the burden you imposed on them by adding your contempt , '' ","i":41178},{"w":"`` No , '' ","i":41614},{"w":"`` You find illustrated here , '' ","i":41885},{"w":"`` Yes , '' ","i":42720},{"w":"`` Not as with you , certainly , '' ","i":43147},{"w":"`` but nevertheless in one way . The price of every book is made up of the cost of its publication with a royalty for the author . The author fixes this royalty at any figure he pleases . Of course if he puts it unreasonably high it is his own loss , for the book will not sell . The amount of this royalty is set to his credit and he is discharged from other service to the nation for so long a period as this credit at the rate of allowance for the support of citizens shall suffice to support him . If his book be moderately successful , he has thus a furlough for several months , a year , two or three years , and if he in the mean time produces other successful work , the remission of service is extended so far as the sale of that may justify . An author of much acceptance succeeds in supporting himself by his pen during the entire period of service , and the degree of any writer 's literary ability , as determined by the popular voice , is thus the measure of the opportunity given him to devote his time to literature . In this respect the outcome of our system is not very dissimilar to that of yours , but there are two notable differences . In the first place , the universally high level of education nowadays gives the popular verdict a conclusiveness on the real merit of literary work which in your day it was as far as possible from having . In the second place , there is no such thing now as favoritism of any sort to interfere with the recognition of true merit . Every author has precisely the same facilities for bringing his work before the popular tribunal . To judge from the complaints of the writers of your day , this absolute equality of opportunity would have been greatly prized . '' ","i":43160},{"w":"`` You had no choice , my dear , but to take your father as you found him and make the best of him , '' ","i":43841},{"w":"`` but as for your mother , there , she would never have had me if I had not assured her that I was bound to get the red ribbon or at least the blue .

At the same time our system is elastic enough to give free play to every instinct of human nature which does not aim at dominating others or living on the fruit of others ' labor . There is not only the remission by indemnification but the remission by abnegation . Any man in his thirty-third year , his term of service being then half done , can obtain an honorable discharge from the army , provided he accepts for the rest of his life one half the rate of maintenance other citizens receive . It is quite possible to live on this amount , though one must forego the luxuries and elegancies of life , with some , perhaps , of its comforts . '' ","i":45178},{"w":"`` As for your being a guest in my house , '' ","i":47125},{"w":"`` I pray you not to begin to be uneasy on that point , for I mean to keep you a long time yet .

But if I am to be a permanent citizen of this century I must have some standing in it . Now , in my time a person more or less entering the world , however he got in , would not be noticed in the unorganized throng of men , and might make a place for himself anywhere he chose if he were strong enough . But nowadays everybody is a part of a system with a distinct place and function . I am outside the system , and do n't see how I can get in ; there seems no way to get in , except to be born in or to come in as an emigrant from some other system . '' ","i":47201},{"w":"`` If that were the most efficient service you were able to render the nation , you would find that avocation considered quite as respectable as any other , '' ","i":47682},{"w":"`` but you can do something else better . You are easily the master of all our historians on questions relating to the social condition of the latter part of the nineteenth century , to us one of the most absorbingly interesting periods of history : and whenever in due time you have sufficiently familiarized yourself with our institutions , and are willing to teach us something concerning those of your day , you will find an historical lectureship in one of our colleges awaiting you .

'' ","i":48181},{"w":"`` That would be tyranny indeed , '' ","i":48942},{"w":"`` and you may be very sure that it does not happen with us , to whom liberty is as dear as equality or fraternity . As you come to know our system better , you will see that our officials are in fact , and not merely in name , the agents and servants of the people . The administration has no power to stop the production of any commodity for which there continues to be a demand . Suppose the demand for any article declines to such a point that its production becomes very costly . The price has to be raised in proportion , of course , but as long as the consumer cares to pay it , the production goes on . Again , suppose an article not before produced is demanded . If the administration doubts the reality of the demand , a popular petition guaranteeing a certain basis of consumption compels it to produce the desired article . A government , or a majority , which should undertake to tell the people , or a minority , what they were to eat , drink , or wear , as I believe governments in America did in your day , would be regarded as a curious anachronism indeed . Possibly you had reasons for tolerating these infringements of personal independence , but we should not think them endurable . I am glad you raised this point , for it has given me a chance to show you how much more direct and efficient is the control over production exercised by the individual citizen now than it was in your day , when what you called private initiative prevailed , though it should have been called capitalist initiative , for the average private citizen had little enough share in it .

All this merely shows , my dear fellow , how much easier it is to do things the right way than the wrong .

The generous rivalry existing between the various guilds , and the loyalty of each worker to his own , afford a constant stimulation to all sorts of games and matches by sea and land , in which the young men take scarcely more interest than the honorary guildsmen who have served their time . The guild yacht races off Marblehead take place next week , and you will be able to judge for yourself of the popular enthusiasm which such events nowadays call out as compared with your day . The demand for ` panem ef circenses ' preferred by the Roman populace is recognized nowadays as a wholly reasonable one . If bread is the first necessity of life , recreation is a close second , and the nation caters for both . Americans of the nineteenth century were as unfortunate in lacking an adequate provision for the one sort of need as for the other . Even if the people of that period had enjoyed larger leisure , they would , I fancy , have often been at a loss how to pass it agreeably . We are never in that predicament . '' ","i":52806},{"w":"`` That went before my day , but I remember hearing about it , '' ","i":53101},{"w":"`` Why , yes , '' ","i":53159},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , '' ","i":53252},{"w":"`` but since you have so explicitly asked the question , I am forced to say that the fact is precisely that . '' ","i":53271},{"w":"`` In point of fact , '' ","i":53499},{"w":"`` our use of the word is no reflection at all on your generation , if , begging Edith 's pardon , we may call it yours , so far as seeming to imply that we think ourselves , apart from our circumstances , better than you were . In your day fully nineteen twentieths of the crime , using the word broadly to include all sorts of misdemeanors , resulted from the inequality in the possessions of individuals ; want tempted the poor , lust of greater gains , or the desire to preserve former gains , tempted the well-to-do . Directly or indirectly , the desire for money , which then meant every good thing , was the motive of all this crime , the taproot of a vast poison growth , which the machinery of law , courts , and police could barely prevent from choking your civilization outright . When we made the nation the sole trustee of the wealth of the people , and guaranteed to all abundant maintenance , on the one hand abolishing want , and on the other checking the accumulation of riches , we cut this root , and the poison tree that overshadowed your society withered , like Jonah 's gourd , in a day . As for the comparatively small class of violent crimes against persons , unconnected with any idea of gain , they were almost wholly confined , even in your day , to the ignorant and bestial ; and in these days , when education and good manners are not the monopoly of a few , but universal , such atrocities are scarcely ever heard of . You now see why the word ` atavism ' is used for crime . It is because nearly all forms of crime known to you are motiveless now , and when they appear can only be explained as the outcropping of ancestral traits . You used to call persons who stole , evidently without any rational motive , kleptomaniacs , and when the case was clear deemed it absurd to punish them as thieves . Your attitude toward the genuine kleptomaniac is precisely ours toward the victim of atavism , an attitude of compassion and firm but gentle restraint . '' ","i":53510},{"w":"`` We do without the lawyers , certainly , '' ","i":53978},{"w":"`` If he is a criminal he needs no defense , for he pleads guilty in most instances , '' ","i":54046},{"w":"`` I should not fail to speak of one important function of the minor judges , '' ","i":55231},{"w":"`` We have no legislation , '' ","i":55714},{"w":"`` If it took half the revenue of the nation , nobody would grudge it , '' ","i":57787},{"w":"`` nor even if it took it all save a bare pittance . But in truth the expense of educating ten thousand youth is not ten nor five times that of educating one thousand . The principle which makes all operations on a large scale proportionally cheaper than on a small scale holds as to education also . '' ","i":57808},{"w":"`` it was not college education but college dissipation and extravagance which cost so highly . The actual expense of your colleges appears to have been very low , and would have been far lower if their patronage had been greater . The higher education nowadays is as cheap as the lower , as all grades of teachers , like all other workers , receive the same support . We have simply added to the common school system of compulsory education , in vogue in Massachusetts a hundred years ago , a half dozen higher grades , carrying the youth to the age of twenty-one and giving him what you used to call the education of a gentleman , instead of turning him loose at fourteen or fifteen with no mental equipment beyond reading , writing , and the multiplication table . '' ","i":57896},{"w":"`` We should not concede you any gain even in material product by that plan , '' ","i":58095},{"w":"`` Ah , '' ","i":58441},{"w":"`` There is still another point I should mention in stating the grounds on which nothing less than the universality of the best education could now be tolerated , '' ","i":59236},{"w":"`` and that is , the interest of the coming generation in having educated parents . To put the matter in a nutshell , there are three main grounds on which our educational system rests : first , the right of every man to the completest education the nation can give him on his own account , as necessary to his enjoyment of himself ; second , the right of his fellow-citizens to have him educated , as necessary to their enjoyment of his society ; third , the right of the unborn to be guaranteed an intelligent and refined parentage . '' ","i":59270},{"w":"`` The faculty of education , '' ","i":59463},{"w":"`` is held to the same responsibility for the bodies as for the minds of its charges . The highest possible physical , as well as mental , development of every one is the double object of a curriculum which lasts from the age of six to that of twenty-one . '' ","i":59474},{"w":"`` That is a very pertinent question , Mr. West , '' ","i":60352},{"w":"`` I beg your pardon , '' ","i":60950},{"w":"`` Now , Mr. West , '' ","i":64355},{"w":"`` Well , '' ","i":64984},{"w":"`` we are pretty well off . The rate at which we live is as luxurious as we could wish . The rivalry of ostentation , which in your day led to extravagance in no way conducive to comfort , finds no place , of course , in a society of people absolutely equal in resources , and our ambition stops at the surroundings which minister to the enjoyment of life . We might , indeed , have much larger incomes , individually , if we chose so to use the surplus of our product , but we prefer to expend it upon public works and pleasures in which all share , upon public halls and buildings , art galleries , bridges , statuary , means of transit , and the conveniences of our cities , great musical and theatrical exhibitions , and in providing on a vast scale for the recreations of the people . You have not begun to see how we live yet , Mr. West . At home we have comfort , but the splendor of our life is , on its social side , that which we share with our fellows . When you know more of it you will see where the money goes , as you used to say , and I think you will agree that we do well so to expend it . '' ","i":64992},{"w":"`` I suppose , '' ","i":65225},{"w":"`` that no reflection would have cut the men of your wealth-worshiping century more keenly than the suggestion that they did not know how to make money . Nevertheless that is just the verdict history has passed on them . Their system of unorganized and antagonistic industries was as absurd economically as it was morally abominable . Selfishness was their only science , and in industrial production selfishness is suicide . Competition , which is the instinct of selfishness , is another word for dissipation of energy , while combination is the secret of efficient production ; and not till the idea of increasing the individual hoard gives place to the idea of increasing the common stock can industrial combination be realized , and the acquisition of wealth really begin . Even if the principle of share and share alike for all men were not the only humane and rational basis for a society , we should still enforce it as economically expedient , seeing that until the disintegrating influence of self-seeking is suppressed no true concert of industry is possible . '' ","i":65243},{"w":"`` They had nothing to do with it except to hinder it , of course , '' ","i":67199},{"w":"`` Certainly , '' ","i":67278},{"w":"`` So far as we men are concerned , '' ","i":68035},{"w":"`` we should consider that they amply paid their way , to use one of your forms of expression , if they confined themselves to that occupation , but you may be very sure that they have quite too much spirit to consent to be mere beneficiaries of society , even as a return for ornamenting it . They did , indeed , welcome their riddance from housework , because that was not only exceptionally wearing in itself , but also wasteful , in the extreme , of energy , as compared with the cooperative plan ; but they accepted relief from that sort of work only that they might contribute in other and more effectual , as well as more agreeable , ways to the common weal . Our women , as well as our men , are members of the industrial army , and leave it only when maternal duties claim them . The result is that most women , at one time or another of their lives , serve industrially some five or ten or fifteen years , while those who have no children fill out the full term . '' ","i":68049},{"w":"`` They are under an entirely different discipline , '' ","i":68741},{"w":"`` and constitute rather an allied force than an integral part of the army of the men . They have a woman general-in-chief and are under exclusively feminine regime . This general , as also the higher officers , is chosen by the body of women who have passed the time of service , in correspondence with the manner in which the chiefs of the masculine army and the President of the nation are elected . The general of the women 's army sits in the cabinet of the President and has a veto on measures respecting women 's work , pending appeals to Congress . I should have said , in speaking of the judiciary , that we have women on the bench , appointed by the general of the women , as well as men . Causes in which both parties are women are determined by women judges , and where a man and a woman are parties to a case , a judge of either sex must consent to the verdict . '' ","i":68755},{"w":"`` To some extent , '' ","i":68952},{"w":"`` but the inner imperium is one from which you will admit there is not likely to be much danger to the nation . The lack of some such recognition of the distinct individuality of the sexes was one of the innumerable defects of your society . The passional attraction between men and women has too often prevented a perception of the profound differences which make the members of each sex in many things strange to the other , and capable of sympathy only with their own . It is in giving full play to the differences of sex rather than in seeking to obliterate them , as was apparently the effort of some reformers in your day , that the enjoyment of each by itself and the piquancy which each has for the other , are alike enhanced . In your day there was no career for women except in an unnatural rivalry with men . We have given them a world of their own , with its emulations , ambitions , and careers , and I assure you they are very happy in it . It seems to us that women were more than any other class the victims of your civilization . There is something which , even at this distance of time , penetrates one with pathos in the spectacle of their ennuied , undeveloped lives , stunted at marriage , their narrow horizon , bounded so often , physically , by the four walls of home , and morally by a petty circle of personal interests . I speak now , not of the poorer classes , who were generally worked to death , but also of the well-to-do and rich . From the great sorrows , as well as the petty frets of life , they had no refuge in the breezy outdoor world of human affairs , nor any interests save those of the family . Such an existence would have softened men 's brains or driven them mad . All that is changed to-day . No woman is heard nowadays wishing she were a man , nor parents desiring boy rather than girl children . Our girls are as full of ambition for their careers as our boys . Marriage , when it comes , does not mean incarceration for them , nor does it separate them in any way from the larger interests of society , the bustling life of the world . Only when maternity fills a woman 's mind with new interests does she withdraw from the world for a time . Afterward , and at any time , she may return to her place among her comrades , nor need she ever lose touch with them . Women are a very happy race nowadays , as compared with what they ever were before in the world 's history , and their power of giving happiness to men has been of course increased in proportion . '' ","i":68962},{"w":"`` Smaller ! '' ","i":69771},{"w":"`` oh , no ! The maintenance of all our people is the same . There are no exceptions to that rule , but if any difference were made on account of the interruptions you speak of , it would be by making the woman 's credit larger , not smaller . Can you think of any service constituting a stronger claim on the nation 's gratitude than bearing and nursing the nation 's children ? According to our view , none deserve so well of the world as good parents . There is no task so unselfish , so necessarily without return , though the heart is well rewarded , as the nurture of the children who are to make the world for one another when we are gone . '' ","i":69779},{"w":"`` Of course they are not , '' ","i":69938},{"w":"`` The change you will observe , '' ","i":70699},{"w":"`` will chiefly be , I think , the entire frankness and unconstraint which now characterizes those relations , as compared with the artificiality which seems to have marked them in your time . The sexes now meet with the ease of perfect equals , suitors to each other for nothing but love . In your time the fact that women were dependent for support on men made the woman in reality the one chiefly benefited by marriage . This fact , so far as we can judge from contemporary records , appears to have been coarsely enough recognized among the lower classes , while among the more polished it was glossed over by a system of elaborate conventionalities which aimed to carry the precisely opposite meaning , namely , that the man was the party chiefly benefited . To keep up this convention it was essential that he should always seem the suitor . Nothing was therefore considered more shocking to the proprieties than that a woman should betray a fondness for a man before he had indicated a desire to marry her . Why , we actually have in our libraries books , by authors of your day , written for no other purpose than to discuss the question whether , under any conceivable circumstances , a woman might , without discredit to her sex , reveal an unsolicited love . All this seems exquisitely absurd to us , and yet we know that , given your circumstances , the problem might have a serious side . When for a woman to proffer her love to a man was in effect to invite him to assume the burden of her support , it is easy to see that pride and delicacy might well have checked the promptings of the heart . When you go out into our society , Mr. West , you must be prepared to be often cross-questioned on this point by our young people , who are naturally much interested in this aspect of old-fashioned manners . '' ","i":70711},{"w":"`` If they choose , '' ","i":71071},{"w":"`` That is a matter of course , '' ","i":71178},{"w":"`` We had prophets who foretold that long before this time the world would have dispensed with both . I am very curious to know how the ecclesiastical systems fit in with the rest of your social arrangements . I suppose you have a sort of national church with official clergymen . '' ","i":72441},{"w":"`` The religious practices of the people have naturally changed considerably in a century , '' ","i":72584},{"w":"`` but supposing them to have remained unchanged , our social system would accommodate them perfectly . The nation supplies any person or number of persons with buildings on guarantee of the rent , and they remain tenants while they pay it . As for the clergymen , if a number of persons wish the services of an individual for any particular end of their own , apart from the general service of the nation , they can always secure it , with that individual 's own consent , of course , just as we secure the service of our editors , by contributing from their credit cards an indemnity to the nation for the loss of his services in general industry . This indemnity paid the nation for the individual answers to the salary in your day paid to the individual himself ; and the various applications of this principle leave private initiative full play in all details to which national control is not applicable . Now , as to hearing a sermon to-day , if you wish to do so , you can either go to a church to hear it or stay at home . '' ","i":72604},{"w":"`` I shall be very jealous for her . I shall not let you forget her . I am going to tell you something which you may think strange . Do you not believe that spirits sometimes come back to the world to fulfill some work that lay near their hearts ? What if I were to tell you that I have sometimes thought that her spirit lives in me -- that Edith Bartlett , not Edith Leete , is my real name . I can not know it ; of course none of us can know who we really are ; but I can feel it . Can you wonder that I have such a feeling , seeing how my life was affected by her and by you , even before you came .

He took me there not long ago , and it was a wonderful sight . The system is certainly perfect ; for example , over yonder in that sort of cage is the dispatching clerk . The orders , as they are taken by the different departments in the store , are sent by transmitters to him . His assistants sort them and enclose each class in a carrier-box by itself . The dispatching clerk has a dozen pneumatic transmitters before him answering to the general classes of goods , each communicating with the corresponding department at the warehouse . He drops the box of orders into the tube it calls for , and in a few moments later it drops on the proper desk in the warehouse , together with all the orders of the same sort from the other sample stores . The orders are read off , recorded , and sent to be filled , like lightning . The filling I thought the most interesting part . Bales of cloth are placed on spindles and turned by machinery , and the cutter , who also has a machine , works right through one bale after another till exhausted , when another man takes his place ; and it is the same with those who fill the orders in any other staple . The packages are then delivered by larger tubes to the city districts , and thence distributed to the houses .

The larger houses are usually occupied by large families , in which there are several to contribute to the rent ; while small families , like ours , find smaller houses more convenient and economical .

There are a number of music rooms in the city , perfectly adapted acoustically to the different sorts of music . These halls are connected by telephone with all the houses of the city whose people care to pay the small fee , and there are none , you may be sure , who do not . The corps of musicians attached to each hall is so large that , although no individual performer , or group of performers , has more than a brief part , each day 's programme lasts through the twenty-four hours .
