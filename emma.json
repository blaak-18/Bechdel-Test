She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right . That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ; -- William Coxe -- Oh ! no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer .

Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use ! -- Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him ! -- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could ! -- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ? '' ","i":56437},{"w":"`` We shall never agree about him , '' ","i":57166},{"w":"`` but that is nothing extraordinary . I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others . '' ","i":57178},{"w":"`` I will say no more about him , '' ","i":57998},{"w":"`` you turn every thing to evil .

'' ","i":58309},{"w":"`` Oh ! yes -- Mr. Elton , I understand -- certainly as to dancing -- Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was -- Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us , talking of Jane ; for as soon as she came in , she began inquiring after her , Jane is so very great a favourite there . Whenever she is with us , Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can . And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ' I know you can not have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ; ' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning , ' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized . ` Have you , upon your honour ? ' said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected . Do let me hear what she says . ' '' ","i":58952},{"w":"`` Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ? I am extremely happy . I hope she is well ? '' ","i":59167},{"w":"`` So obliging of you ! No , we should not have heard , if it had not been for this particular circumstance , of her being to come here so soon . My mother is so delighted ! -- for she is to be three months with us at least . Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you . The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland . Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly . They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane 's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon 's name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly-craig , a beautiful place , I fancy . Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr. Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter 's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself . He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe . Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things . '' ","i":60151},{"w":"`` I am afraid we must be running away , '' ","i":61665},{"w":"`` At a watering-place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points . Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill . She believed every body found his manners pleasing .

'' ","i":65300},{"w":"`` Oh ! my dear sir , how are you this morning ? My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over-powered . Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork ! You are too bountiful ! Have you heard the news ? Mr. Elton is going to be married . '' ","i":65810},{"w":"`` It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course . '' ","i":66367},{"w":"`` Mr. Elton going to be married ! '' ","i":66449},{"w":"`` Who shall answer that question ? '' ","i":66646},{"w":"`` As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her , '' ","i":67002},{"w":"`` nothing I suppose can be known . One feels that it can not be a very long acquaintance . He has been gone only four weeks . '' ","i":67027},{"w":"`` You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news . You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell 's account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins . '' ","i":67074},{"w":"`` Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away . The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy . You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave . This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed . I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole 's ; but I shall not stop three minutes : and , Jane , you had better go home directly -- I would not have you out in a shower ! -- We think she is the better for Highbury already . Thank you , we do indeed . I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing . Good morning to you , my dear sir . Oh ! Mr. Knightley is coming too . Well , that is so very ! -- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm . -- Mr. Elton , and Miss Hawkins ! -- Good morning to you . '' ","i":67551},{"w":"`` And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd ! -- but they always dealt at Ford 's -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother ! -- Dear Miss Woodhouse ! only think . I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door ! -- Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there . -- Oh ! dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- -LRB- do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ? -RRB- -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to try to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble ! -- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think ! -- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly . And Elizabeth , too . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again . '' ","i":68204},{"w":"`` This is too bad , '' ","i":72140},{"w":"`` And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking ! -- I do not know when I have been so disappointed . '' ","i":72155},{"w":"`` Well , well , I am ready ; '' ","i":72628},{"w":"`` but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man ; you have only had my account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary : '' ","i":72645},{"w":"`` You can not see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings , '' ","i":74036},{"w":"`` were you to guess her to be eighteen , I should listen with pleasure ; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .

'' ","i":74877},{"w":"`` Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill . But the expression is hardly admissible , Mrs. Weston , is it ? Ladies can never look ill .

If he were , he would have done this differently . He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it . There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities . -- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly .

Shall I ? -- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ; -- whether she colours . '' ","i":85925},{"w":"`` Very likely , '' ","i":86559},{"w":"`` nothing more likely . I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good-natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent . He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax 's ill-health , would appear a case of humanity to him ; -- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley . I know he had horses to-day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray . '' ","i":86567},{"w":"`` Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax !

' -- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me . -- ` Oh , ' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job ; ' -- For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother 's spectacles . -- The rivet came out , you know , this morning . -- So very obliging ! -- For my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on . And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed . Jane said so . I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know . At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping . Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me . Here is the rivet of your mistress 's spectacles out . Then the baked apples came home , Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them . And it can not be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ? Only three of us . -- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it . I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off . But about the middle of the day she gets hungry , and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples , and they are extremely wholesome , for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry ; I happened to meet him in the street . Not that I had any doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple . I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome . We have apple-dumplings , however , very often . Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling . Well , Mrs. Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us .

And as to its recommendations to you , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them . The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood . It would be a charming introduction for you , who have lived so secluded a life ; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place .

Oh ! here it is . I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table . I was reading it to Mrs. Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ; -- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half . My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well . She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work ' -- do n't you , ma'am ? -- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . It is such a blessing ! My mother 's are really very good indeed .

Jane , you have never seen Mr. Elton ! -- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him . '' ","i":66546},{"w":"`` Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse , '' ","i":67192},{"w":"`` four weeks yesterday . -- A Miss Hawkins ! -- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs. Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man -- but ' -- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries . I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good-humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children . Jane , do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley . I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative . '' ","i":67215},{"w":"`` Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ? Go , and interfere . They have no mercy on her . '' ","i":88987},{"w":"`` How do you do , Mrs. Ford ? I beg your pardon . I did not see you before . I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town . Jane came back delighted yesterday . Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in . '' ","i":92208},{"w":"`` I declare I can not recollect what I was talking of . -- Oh ! my mother 's spectacles . So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill ! ` Oh ! ' said he , ' I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively . ' -- Which you know shewed him to be so very ... . Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing ... . I do congratulate you , Mrs. Weston , most warmly . He seems every thing the fondest parent could ... ` Oh ! ' said he , ' I can fasten the rivet . I like a job of that sort excessively . ' I never shall forget his manner . And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh ! ' said he directly , ` there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good , and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life . ' That , you know , was so very ... . And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment . Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it . The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr. Knightley 's most liberal supply . He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them . My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days . But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr. Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock . ' I am sure you must be , ' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use . William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year . I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing . ' So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same . And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left . Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could . However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose . William Larkins is such an old acquaintance ! I am always glad to see him . But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil . William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master 's profit than any thing ; but Mrs. Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away . She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring . He told Patty this , but bid her not mind it , and be sure not to say any thing to us about it , for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes , and as long as so many sacks were sold , it did not signify who ate the remainder . And so Patty told me , and I was excessively shocked indeed ! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world ! He would be so very ... . I wanted to keep it from Jane 's knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware . '' ","i":92309},{"w":"`` I do not see much sign of it . She is playing Robin Adair at this moment -- his favourite . '' ","i":94726},{"w":"`` How d' ye do ? -- how d'ye do ? -- Very well , I thank you . So obliged to you for the carriage last night . We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us . Pray come in ; do come in . You will find some friends here . '' ","i":94894},{"w":"`` So obliged to you ! -- so very much obliged to you for the carriage , '' ","i":95075},{"w":"`` Yes -- I have called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .

It was better to pay my visit , then '' ","i":101325},{"w":"`` In short , '' ","i":101429},{"w":"`` perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion '' ","i":101437},{"w":"`` It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield .

Could not have imagined it . -- So well lighted up ! -- Jane , Jane , look ! -- did you ever see any thing ? Oh ! Mr. Weston , you must really have had Aladdin 's lamp . Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again . I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance . ` Oh ! Mrs. Stokes , ' said I -- but I had not time for more . '' ","i":125413},{"w":"`` Why , to own the truth , '' ","i":135384},{"w":"`` if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days . Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed . Jane , do n't you remember grandmama 's telling us of it when we got home ? I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls . Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of . At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware . I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not . I am not like Jane ; I wish I were . I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world . Where is she ? -- Oh ! just behind . Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry 's coming . -- Extraordinary dream , indeed !

It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh ! no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that . Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy 's son wanted to speak with him . Poor old John , I have a great regard for him ; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years ; and now , poor old man , he is bed-ridden , and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- I must go and see him to-day ; and so will Jane , I am sure , if she gets out at all . And poor John 's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he can not keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr. Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond .

Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman . '' ","i":21324},{"w":"`` Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her . What is the foolish girl about ? '' ","i":22284},{"w":"`` Not Harriet 's equal ! '' ","i":22521},{"w":"`` No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation . Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you . What are Harriet Smith 's claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations . She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school . She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information . She has been taught nothing useful , and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself . At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her . She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all . My only scruple in advising the match was on his account , as being beneath his deserts , and a bad connexion for him . I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse . But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well . The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt -LRB- nor have I now -RRB- that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck . Even your satisfaction I made sure of . It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend 's leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well . I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match . ' '' ","i":22547},{"w":"`` Whoever might be her parents , '' ","i":23250},{"w":"`` whoever may have had the charge of her , it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society . After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard 's hands to shift as she can ; -- to move , in short , in Mrs. Goddard 's line , to have Mrs. Goddard 's acquaintance . Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it was good enough . She desired nothing better herself . Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it . She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer . She had no sense of superiority then . If she has it now , you have given it . You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma . Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him . I know him well . He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion . And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know . Depend upon it he had encouragement . '' ","i":23262},{"w":"`` I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy , '' ","i":23969},{"w":"`` though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet . You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty , and of what she has a claim to , that , in a little while , nobody within her reach will be good enough for her . Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief . Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high . Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl . Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives . Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed . Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard 's all the rest of her life -- or , at least , -LRB- for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other , -RRB- till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing-master 's son .

It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin . While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .
