Jo,Meg,"""I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake."""
Jo,Meg,"""If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,"""

Aunt March,Jo,"""Josy-phine!"""
Beth,Jo,"""Jo, dear, don't hope any more.  It won't do any good.  I'm sure of that.  We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me."""
Jo,Amy,"""Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate, Amy"""
Jo,Meg,"""Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all"""
Jo,Amy,"""You can't go, Amy , so don't be a baby and whine about it."""
Jo,Miss. Lamb,"""Oh, Amy painted it.  You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like.  It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister."""
Jo,Amy,"""What a good girl you are, Amy!"""
Jo,Amy,"""Come, Amy"""
Jo,Amy,"""You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart,"""

Jo,Beth,"""Good-by, my Beth. Good-by!"""
Jo,Beth,"""What are you thinking of, Beth?"""

Jo,Beth,"""I'll try, Beth"""
Amy,Esther,"""Do you think so?  Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring!  It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.  I do like Aunt March after all."""
Amy,Meg,"""Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for tomorrow,"""
Amy,Jo,"""Please forgive me, Jo. I 'm very, very sorry"""
Amy,Jo,"""Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people , so I want you to put on your best deportment . Don't make any of your abrupt remarks , or do anything odd , will you ?

Meg,Jo,"""You have been running, Jo. How could you ? When will you stop such romping ways?"""
Meg,Amy,"""As for you, Amy"""
Meg,Amy,"""In debt, Amy? What do you mean?"""
Jo,Marmee,"""Of course not.  It would be idiotic!  I knew there was mischiefbrewing.  I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family."""
Meg,Beth,"""Beth , if you do n't keep these horrid cats down cellar I 'll have them drowned"""
Beth,Jo,"""I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're a regular Shakespeare!"""
Beth,Jo,"""I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!"""
Beth,Jo,"""Can't you, Jo?"""
Beth,Jo,"""Jo, please."""
Beth,Jo,"""Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you are not going quite yet"""
